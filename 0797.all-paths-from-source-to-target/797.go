/**
 * Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1, and return them in any order.
 * The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i (i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).
 *
 * Example 1:
 * (https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_1.jpg)
 * Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]
 * Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]
 * Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * (https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/28/all_2.jpg)
 * Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]
 * Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: graph = [[1],[]]
 * Output: [[0,1]]
 *
 * Example 4:
 *
 * Input: graph = [[1,2,3],[2],[3],[]]
 * Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,2,3],[0,3]]
 *
 * Example 5:
 *
 * Input: graph = [[1,3],[2],[3],[]]
 * Output: [[0,1,2,3],[0,3]]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	n == graph.length
 * 	2 <= n <= 15
 * 	0 <= graph[i][j] < n
 * 	graph[i][j] != i (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
 * 	The input graph is guaranteed to be a DAG.
