/**
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.
 *
 * <u>Definition of a complete binary tree from (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees (Wikipedia)):</u><br />
 * In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * (https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-1.png)
 *
 *
 * Input: <span id="example-input-1-1">[1,2,3,4,5,6]</span>
 * Output: <span id="example-output-1">true</span>
 * <span>Explanation: </span>Every level before the last is full (ie. levels with node-values {1} and {2, 3}), and all nodes in the last level ({4, 5, 6}) are as far left as possible.
 *
 *
 * <div>
 * Example 2:
 *
 * (https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/15/complete-binary-tree-2.png)
 *
 *
 * Input: <span id="example-input-2-1">[1,2,3,4,5,null,7]</span>
 * Output: <span id="example-output-2">false</span>
 * Explanation: The node with value 7 isn't as far left as possible.<span>
 * </span>
 *
 * <div> </div>
 * </div>
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * <ol>
 * 	The tree will have between 1 and 100 nodes.
 * </ol>
