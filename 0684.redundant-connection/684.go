/**
 *
 * In this problem, a tree is an undirected graph that is connected and has no cycles.
 *
 * The given input is a graph that started as a tree with N nodes (with distinct values 1, 2, ..., N), with one additional edge added.  The added edge has two different vertices chosen from 1 to N, and was not an edge that already existed.
 *
 * The resulting graph is given as a 2D-array of edges.  Each element of edges is a pair [u, v] with u < v, that represents an undirected edge connecting nodes u and v.
 *
 * Return an edge that can be removed so that the resulting graph is a tree of N nodes.  If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.  The answer edge [u, v] should be in the same format, with u < v.
 * Example 1:<br />
 *
 * Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
 * Output: [2,3]
 * Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
 *   1
 *  / \
 * 2 - 3
 *
 *
 * Example 2:<br />
 *
 * Input: [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,4], [1,5]]
 * Output: [1,4]
 * Explanation: The given undirected graph will be like this:
 * 5 - 1 - 2
 *     |   |
 *     4 - 3
 *
 *
 * Note:<br />
 * The size of the input 2D-array will be between 3 and 1000.
 * Every integer represented in the 2D-array will be between 1 and N, where N is the size of the input array.
 *

 * We have overhauled the problem description + test cases and specified clearly the graph is an undirected graph. For the directed graph follow up please see (https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection-ii/description/ (Redundant Connection II))). We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
