/**
 * Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference (absolute difference)) between values of any two nodes.
 * Example:
 *
 * Input:
 *    1
 *     \
 *      3
 *     /
 *    2
 * Output:
 * 1
 * Explanation:
 * The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * 	There are at least two nodes in this BST.
 * 	This question is the same as 783: (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/ (https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/))
