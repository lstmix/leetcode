/**
 * An N x N board contains only 0s and 1s. In each move, you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.
 *
 * What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard" - a board where no 0s and no 1s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return -1.
 *
 *
 * Examples:
 * Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation:
 * One potential sequence of moves is shown below, from left to right:
 *
 * 0110     1010     1010
 * 0110 --> 1010 --> 0101
 * 1001     0101     1010
 * 1001     0101     0101
 *
 * The first move swaps the first and second column.
 * The second move swaps the second and third row.
 *
 *
 * Input: board = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner,
 * 01
 * 10
 *
 * is also a valid chessboard.
 *
 * Input: board = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation:
 * No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 	board will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range [2, 30].
 * 	board[i][j] will be only 0s or 1s.
 *
