/**
 * We are given a 2-dimensional grid. "." is an empty cell, "#" is a wall, "@" is the starting point, ("a", "b", ...) are keys, and ("A", "B", ...) are locks.
 *
 * We start at the starting point, and one move consists of walking one space in one of the 4 cardinal directions.  We cannot walk outside the grid, or walk into a wall.  If we walk over a key, we pick it up.  We can't walk over a lock unless we have the corresponding key.
 *
 * For some <font face="monospace">1 <= K <= 6</font>, there is exactly one lowercase and one uppercase letter of the first K letters of the English alphabet in the grid.  This means that there is exactly one key for each lock, and one lock for each key; and also that the letters used to represent the keys and locks were chosen in the same order as the English alphabet.
 *
 * Return the lowest number of moves to acquire all keys.  If it's impossible, return -1.
 *
 *
 *
 * <div>
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input: <span id="example-input-1-1">["@.a.#","###.#","b.A.B"]</span>
 * Output: <span id="example-output-1">8</span>
 *
 *
 * <div>
 * Example 2:
 *
 *
 * Input: <span id="example-input-2-1">["@..aA","..B#.","....b"]</span>
 * Output: <span id="example-output-2">6</span>
 *
 * </div>
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 * <ol>
 * 	1 <= grid.length <= 30
 * 	1 <= grid[0].length <= 30
 * 	grid[i][j] contains only '.', '#', '@', 'a'-'f' and 'A'-'F'
 * 	The number of keys is in [1, 6].  Each key has a different letter and opens exactly one lock.
 * </ol>
 * </div>
