/**
 * There are a total of numCourses courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to numCourses-1.
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 *              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 *              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
 *              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about (https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs (how a graph is represented)).
 * 	You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
 * 	1 <= numCourses <= 10^5
