/**
 * Implement FreqStack, a class which simulates the operation of a stack-like data structure.
 *
 * FreqStack has two functions:
 *
 *
 * 	push(int x), which pushes an integer x onto the stack.
 * 	pop(), which removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.
 *
 * 		If there is a tie for most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * <span id="example-input-1-1">["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"]</span>,
 * <span id="example-input-1-2">[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]</span>
 * Output: <span id="example-output-1">[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]</span>
 * Explanation:
 * After making six .push operations, the stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5] from bottom to top.  Then:
 *
 * pop() -> returns 5, as 5 is the most frequent.
 * The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
 *
 * pop() -> returns 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top.
 * The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
 *
 * pop() -> returns 5.
 * The stack becomes [5,7,4].
 *
 * pop() -> returns 4.
 * The stack becomes [5,7].
 *
 *
 *
 *
 * Note:
 *
 *
 * 	Calls to FreqStack.push(int x) will be such that 0 <= x <= 10^9.
 * 	It is guaranteed that FreqStack.pop() won't be called if the stack has zero elements.
 * 	The total number of FreqStack.push calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
 * 	The total number of FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 10000 in a single test case.
 * 	The total number of FreqStack.push and FreqStack.pop calls will not exceed 150000 across all test cases.
