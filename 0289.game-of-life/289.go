/**
 * According to the (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life (Wikipedia's article)): "The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."
 *
 * Given a board with m by n cells, each cell has an initial state live (1) or dead (0). Each cell interacts with its (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood (eight neighbors)) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):
 *
 * <ol>
 * 	Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
 * 	Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
 * 	Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
 * 	Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
 * </ol>
 *
 * Write a function to compute the next state (after one update) of the board given its current state. <span>The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously.</span>
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *
 * Input:
 * <span id="example-input-1-1">[
 *   [0,1,0],
 *   [0,0,1],
 *   [1,1,1],
 *   [0,0,0]
 * ]</span>
 * Output:
 * <span id="example-output-1">[
 *   [0,0,0],
 *   [1,0,1],
 *   [0,1,1],
 *   [0,1,0]
 * ]</span>
 *
 *
 * Follow up:
 *
 * <ol>
 * 	Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated at the same time: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
 * 	In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches the border of the array. How would you address these problems?
 * </ol>
