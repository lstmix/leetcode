/**
 * Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.
 * For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
 * <blockquote>
 * a binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.
 * </blockquote>
 *
 * Example 1:
 * (https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_1.jpg)
 * Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
 * Output: true
 *
 * Example 2:
 * (https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_2.jpg)
 * Input: root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]
 * Output: false
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: root = []
 * Output: true
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 	The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5000].
 * 	-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
 *
